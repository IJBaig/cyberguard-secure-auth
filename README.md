# CyberGuard: Secure Identity Management & Authentication API

A robust, secure Node.js authentication application developed as part of a Cybersecurity Internship. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of modern web security defense mechanisms, including secure session management, cryptographic password hashing, brute-force protection, and comprehensive audit logging.

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented
This application was built to actively defend against the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities discovered during Week 1 penetration testing:
* **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Strict enforcement of email formats and alphanumeric usernames using `validator` to prevent SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
* **Cryptographic Hashing:** Passwords are never stored in plaintext. Implemented `bcrypt` with a 10-round salt for secure credential storage.
* **Stateless Session Management:** Replaced vulnerable cookie sessions with secure JSON Web Tokens (JWT) featuring strict 1-hour expirations.
* **Brute-Force Protection:** Integrated `express-rate-limit` to automatically block IP addresses after 5 failed authentication attempts within a 15-minute window.
* **Secure HTTP Headers:** Deployed `helmet.js` middleware to automatically set defenses against Clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, and cross-site scripting.
* **Audit Logging:** Implemented `winston` to generate persistent, JSON-formatted `security.log` files tracking all critical application states, successful logins, and blocked attacks.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Security Middleware:** Helmet, Express-Rate-Limit
* **Authentication & Cryptography:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Bcrypt
* **Utilities:** Winston (Logging), Validator (Input Sanitization)
* **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (Glassmorphism UI)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/IJBaig/cyberguard-secure-auth.git](https://github.com/IJBaig/cyberguard-secure-auth.git)
   cd cyberguard-secure-auth
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the secure server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
## 📝 Usage Instructions
1. **Register:** Create a new account. The system enforces strict password complexity (minimum 8 characters, requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
2. **Login:** Authenticate using your credentials. Upon success, a secure JWT is generated and displayed.
3. **Forgot Password:** Test the two-factor identification by providing both your registered username and email to securely reset your password.
4. **Monitor Logs:** Check the generated `security.log` file in the root directory to see the real-time audit trail generated by Winston.
